# TicTacToe
Copy paste code into any Python IDE/Compiler, and have fun! The board is 3x3 and to insert X or O (X goes first), look at your numpad.
If you do not have a numpad, from bottom left it is: 
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3
Game ends when there are no more moves to be made, or 3 in a row are made (side to side, up and down, and diagonally).
Have fun!
